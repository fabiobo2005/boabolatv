# CI/CD workflow to build and deploy the application to Azure Web App
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Create an Azure Web App (Node.js, Linux)
# 2. Set the secret AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE in GitHub repository settings
#    - Download the publish profile from Azure Portal > Web App > Deployment Center > Manage publish profile
#
# This workflow:
# - Runs on push to main, pull requests to main, and manual dispatch
# - Builds the application with linting and tests
# - Deploys to Azure Web App (only on push to main)
